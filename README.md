# Flowgorithm Visual Programming Coursework

-----

Welcome to my repository for **Flowgorithm Visual Programming**\! This repository serves as a centralized collection of assignments, projects, and source code developed during my visual programming course.

## 📝 Overview

This repository is dedicated to my coursework using **Flowgorithm**, a free interactive flowchart interpreter that allows you to write and execute programs using flowcharts. It's an excellent tool for understanding the fundamental concepts of programming before diving into syntax-heavy languages.

A key part of this course involves converting the **Flowgorithm** flowcharts into **Java code** using a provided template, then submitting the Java code for automated checking via **GitHub Actions** (using `.yml` files for autograding).

Here you'll find:

  * **Assignments:** Solutions to various programming problems assigned throughout the course. Each assignment will include both the Flowgorithm `.fprg` file and its converted Java `.java` file.
  * **Projects:** More extensive, multi-part projects demonstrating broader application of visual programming concepts, including their Java implementations.
  * **Source Code:** All `.fprg` (Flowgorithm project files) and `.java` (Java source code) files for easy viewing and execution.

## 🚀 What is Flowgorithm?

Flowgorithm is an educational tool that allows users to create programs using flowcharts. It helps in visualizing the program's logic and flow, making it easier to grasp concepts like:

  * Variables
  * Input/Output
  * Conditional statements (If-Else)
  * Loops (While, For, Do-While)
  * Functions/Procedures
  * Arrays

You can learn more about Flowgorithm and download it from their official website: [www.flowgorithm.org](http://www.flowgorithm.org/)

## ☕ Java Conversion and Autograding

For each task, after designing the logic in Flowgorithm, the flowchart is converted into a **Java program**. This is typically done by utilizing a specific **Java template** provided for the course, which helps structure the Flowgorithm-generated code into a runnable Java application.

The converted Java code is then pushed to this GitHub repository. Upon pushing, **GitHub Actions** (configured through `.yml` workflow files) automatically compile and run tests on the submitted Java code. This **autograding system** provides immediate feedback on the correctness and adherence to assignment specifications.

## 🛠 How to Use the Files

To view or run any of the files in this repository, you'll need the following:

1.  **Flowgorithm:** To open `.fprg` files. Download it from [www.flowgorithm.org](http://www.flowgorithm.org/).
2.  **Java Development Kit (JDK):** To compile and run `.java` files.
3.  **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** Recommended for viewing and editing Java code, and often used in conjunction with the Java template for conversion.

Here's how to get started:

  * **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maxrumbo/Flowgorithm.git
    ```
  * **Open Flowgorithm files:** Navigate to any `.fprg` file and open it directly with Flowgorithm.
  * **Open Java files:** Use VS Code (or your preferred IDE) to open the `.java` files. You can then compile and run them locally if needed.
